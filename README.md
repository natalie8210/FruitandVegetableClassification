3. The download will be a zipped file. Unzip the file, and move the 19 folders inside to the data/raw folder in your cloned repo
4. Note folder 01570623 has their files within a folder labeled jpeg, so you will need to delete the heic files and move the 20 jpeg files into the main folder. Your data/raw folder should include 19 subfolders, each with 20 images inside that are .jpg, .jpeg, or .png
5. Create a venv
6. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Use scripts/preprocess_utils.py extract_features_from_image function to preprocess each photo in each foler, and save the output in data/preprocess.
     * Note the pipeline failed on 12 images, so the final training set will have 368 items. 
8. Use the preprocessed data, 368 items with 94 features, and fruit_labels_metadata for binary and multiclass labels, for your classification.
